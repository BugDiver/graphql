# What is GraphQl ?

In a nutshell, GraphQL is a syntax that describes how to ask for data,

???
GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries by using a type system you define for your data. GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data.
